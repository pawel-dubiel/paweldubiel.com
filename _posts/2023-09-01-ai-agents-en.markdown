The development of artificial intelligence is moving toward the creation of general artificial intelligence (AGI), that is, AI systems at the level of human intelligence, which will be able to learn, reason and solve complex problems on their own. However, before we reach this level, we are facing an era of specialized AI agents working together.

Current AI systems, while increasingly sophisticated, have a narrow range of skills - for example, translating text, recognizing images or predicting customer behavior. They are good at specific, designated tasks, but can't learn new things on their own the way humans can.

In the coming years, however, AI systems will become better at collaborating and coordinating with each other. We will have teams of specialized AI agents, each of which will be an expert in its own field. For example, one AI agent will monitor network traffic and detect anomalies, another will analyze malware, and another will remove threats and improve system security. Thanks to the coordinated work of such agents, we will be able to deal with much more complex security problems than today.

Such cooperation between specialized AI agents will open up new opportunities in many fields, including IT security. For example, teams of security bots that collaboratively detect and neutralize threats in IT systems. Network security systems that combine monitoring, malware analysis and machine learning for intelligent risk assessment. Or administrative assistants that integrate multiple security tools and automate the work of specialists.

Although such teams of cooperative AI agents will not yet reach the level of human intelligence, they will significantly push the boundaries of IT security and information systems protection. Therefore, the period of development of cooperative specialized agents will precede the era of true AGI.
